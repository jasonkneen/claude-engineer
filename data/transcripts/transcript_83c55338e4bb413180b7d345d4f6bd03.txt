</Person1><Person2> "So, what kind of apps are we talking about here?  Just little games, or something more serious?"
</Person2><Person1> "Definitely more than games! He develops cross-platform native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and even Windows Phone.  Titanium SDK, React Native, Flutter – he's got the whole toolkit!"
</Person1><Person2> "Hold on – Windows Phone?!    I thought that was ancient history!  Okay, clearly this guy likes a challenge." 
</Person2><Person1> "Exactly! He seems to thrive on it.   He's worked with everyone from startups to major corporations, building new apps and collaborating on existing projects.  The guy is everywhere!"
</Person1><Person2> "So, he's like a mobile app Swiss Army knife? Design, development, CTO duties...  It sounds almost too good to be true!"
</Person2><Person1> "Well,  the proof, as they say, is in the pudding! He's even listed some of his projects. Have you heard of LitterLotto?"
</Person1><Person2> "LitterLotto?  Can't say that I have..."
</Person2><Person1> "It's an app that rewards people for picking up litter. He's the part-time CTO there, managing the entire tech stack, working with the development team, and even acting as Product Manager!  Talk about a multi-tasker!"
</Person1><Person2> "That's impressive! Any other big names on his client list?"
</Person2><Person1> "He's worked with WalkSafe, a walking safety app, helping them secure investment.  And Opus Workspaces, a coworking platform.  He even did some work for UKTV Play!"
</Person1><Person2> "UKTV Play? I have heard of them! So, we're talking about a seriously experienced developer here.  Uh, what about his consulting work? What exactly does he do?"
</Person2><Person1> "He helps with prototypes, wireframes, requirements, and even investor pitches.  He's basically a one-stop shop for app development."
</Person1><Person2> "Wow, so, Jason Kneen designs, develops, consults, and speaks at conferences?  Is there anything this guy can't do?"
</Person2><Person1> "Well, he does mention occasionally doing some .NET and Classic ASP web development. So maybe he dabbles in a bit of everything."
</Person1><Person2> " I see. Interesting. A true Renaissance man of the tech world!  It sounds like if you need an app developed, Jason Kneen is the person to call." 
</Person2><Person1> "Absolutely!    And with that, we'll wrap up this episode of PODCASTIFY.  Thanks for tuning in, everyone, and we'll see you next time!"</Person1>
